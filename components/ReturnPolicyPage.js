                                        (1) A prepaid shipping label will be emailed with your RMA form. Be sure to include both on the return package.<br/>
                                        (2) Once we receive the incorrect part, the correct part will be shipped out as a replacement order. Please know that the returned part must still be in new, uninstalled, and in resalable condition with the original factory packaging; otherwise your return will be rejected.<br/>
                                        (3) If a replacement is not wanted, you can ask for a refund for the cost of the ordered item. The incorrect part must still be returned to us in new condition, in original packaging, and fit for resale, with the genuine manufacturer label unaltered and intact.<br/>

                                        Pictures may be required to authenticate your claim. We do not cross ship under any circumstances, meaning we must receive the returned item(s) before issuing any replacement(s).
